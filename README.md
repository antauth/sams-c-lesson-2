# Sams Teach Yourself C | Lesson 2 | The Components of C Program

## Workshop

1. A **block** is a group of one or more C statements enclosed in braces.
2. The `main` function is the one component that must be present in every C program.
3. You add program comments with `/* */` or `//`. Comments are used to help make code more easy to understand.
4. A **function** is a block of executable statements.
5. The two types of functions are (1) built-in and (2) user-defined. Built-in functions are provided by the C language.
User-defined functions are created by the programmer.
6. The `#include` directive tells C to include the contents of the included file into the program during compilation.
7. Comments cannot be nested.
8. Comments can be longer than one line if using the `/* */` type comments.
9. Another name for an `#include` file is a **header file**.
10. An `#include` file has information that can be used by a C program.

## Files in this repo

- *bigyear.c* was included as an example program.
- *ex02-01.c* is the smallest C program possible.
- *ex02-04.c* was provided and prints out every uppercase letter of the alphabet using `printf` with a `"%c"` first argument.
- *ex02-05.c* was provided code, but I discovered an error when compiling and did some research to determine the appropriate fix.
